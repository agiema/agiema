🌟 Transforming Data into Impact for the Creative Tech, SaaS and e-commerce Industry

Hello! I’m Adrian Ma Kwai Hou, graduating with a Business Administration degree focusing on Information Systems. My passion for data analytics, especially in the Creative Tech, SaaS and e-commerce Industry Industry, stems from the culmination of all my work experiences and a deep appreciation for the creative arts and software community.

🔍 My Journey in Data Analytics

During my internship at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong, I utilized Excel to analyze market trends and buyer preferences, significantly enhancing business decisions. This experience ignited my interest in data visualization, leading me to self-study data analytics and apply these skills to various projects.

Back at UC Riverside, as the Director of Business & Operations for the Deejay & Vinylphiles Club, I leveraged my analytical skills to boost membership and engagement. I also developed comprehensive documentation on survey methodology, dashboard management, and database setup, ensuring future members could independently harness data insights.

🚀 Professional Growth Amid Personal Challenges

After graduation, personal responsibilities required me to focus on my family. During this time, I continued to advance my data analytics skills through personal projects. While my primary interest lies in data analytics for the Arts, Media & Entertainment Industry, I am eager to explore and contribute to various data-driven roles.

👨‍💻 Current Role and Aspirations

At Tabula Rasa, I engineer data pipelines to enhance strategic analysis and decision-making, boosting revenue and operational efficiency. Proficient in Python, SQL, and advanced data visualization, I excel at transforming complex data into actionable insights.

I am open to opportunities where I can apply my robust analytics background, particularly in roles that leverage innovative, data-driven strategies to tackle complex challenges across any industry.
